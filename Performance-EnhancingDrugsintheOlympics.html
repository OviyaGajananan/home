		<h2 id = "Overview" > Overview </h2>
			<p> 
			The first person to test positive for a performance-enhancing substance was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall‚ who was a Swedish pentathlete&sbquo; who won bronze in the 1968 Summer Olympics. 
			The most publicized doping disqualifications occurred in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Ben Johnson&sbquo; a Canadian sprinter&sbquo; tested positive for stanozolol. 
			The WADA&sbquo; World Anti-Doping Agency&sbquo; was formed in 1999 to be able to do more research and be able to detect the use of performance-enhancing drugs. 
			Due to enhanced testing‚ there was an increase in the athletes found doping in the 2000 Winter Olympics.

			According to a 1989 Australian research on the 1980 Summer Olympics&sbquo; there wasn&rsquo;t a single medalist at the Moscow Olympics‚ much less a gold medalist‚ who wasn&rsquo;t on some sort of drug. In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics&sbquo; the Soviet Union planned a statewide doping system in track and field. This theory is backed up by some documents that were discovered in 2016&sbquo; 32 years after the 1984 games. 
			Russia was banned from all major sporting events for four years in December 2019 after associating in systematic doping and lying to WADA. WADA issued the ban on December 9&sbquo; 2019&sbquo; giving RUSADA (Russian Anti-Doping Agency) 21 days to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Russian athletes would only be able to compete under the Olympic flag after clearing anti-doping tests as a result of the ban.
			On December 17&sbquo; 2020&sbquo; the CAS&sbquo; after reviewing Russia&rsquo;s appeal of WADA&rsquo;s decision&sbquo; reduced the penalty imposed by WADA.
			Instead of banning Russia from sporting events&sbquo; the ruling allowed Russia to compete in the Olympics and other international events for two years as a neutral team and athlete.They are allowed to use of the name &ldquo; Russia &rdquo; on team jerseys&sbquo; as well as the usage of Russian flag colours in the design&sbquo; albeit the name must take precedence above the term &ldquo; Neutral Athlete/Team.&rdquo;
			In the 2022 Bejing Olympics there was another doping scandal. 15 year-old Russian skater&sbquo; Kamila Valieva&sbquo; was accused of doping. She tested positive for Trimetazidine. Valieva was cleared to perform in the Women&rsquo;s figure skating&sbquo; causing controversy with players and spectators.

			The first gold medal in the snowboarding event was given Ross Rebagliati, a Canadian. However, his title and medal was taken after he failed a marijuana drug test&sbquo; which was a banned substance. However&sbquo; the Court of Arbitration for Sport later decided to change this decision.
			This was the first time an athlete had lost there medals due to the use of cannabis&sbquo; which has been taken off the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

		<h2 id = "SaltLakeCity" > Salt Lake City 2002 Doping Scandal </h2>
			<p>
			In the Salt Lake City Olympics, there were traces of the banned drug called erythropoietin in almost 100 tests. This was the first instance where all endurance athletes were tested for EPO during the games.
			The skiing event had nine of the 10 positive doping cases.
			Cross-country skier Johann Mühlegg&sbquo; who had won three gold medals at the games&sbquo; tested positive for a substance called darbepoetin. He was later revoked his medal and title.
			</p>
			
		<h2 id = "Turin" > Turin 2006 Doping Scandal </h2>
			<p>
			The first time the IOC punished athletes wihout a positive or missing dope test was with six Austrian athletes. They were banned for life from the Olympics after their involvement in a doping scandal at the games. 
			These athletes possessed doping substances and were said to have took part in a doping conspiracy. The Italian police found more substances during a raid on the athletes&rsquo; lodge.
